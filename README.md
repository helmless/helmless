### üìú Documentation

The documentation site is built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

To setup the development environment, install [Python](https://www.python.org/) using asdf and the following dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

To run the documentation site locally, run:

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

All primary documentation is located in the `docs/docs/` folder and written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with some additional files for the website.

The Chart schemas are written in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) and are located in the `charts/` folder and rendered using a [custom mkdocs plugin](docs/_hooks/schema_renderer.py).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Helm Charts

All charts are written schema and test first and use [helm-unittest](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest) to test the charts. To setup the testing environment, install the helm-unittest plugin:

```sh
helm plugin install https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest.git
```

To run the tests for a chart, navigate to the chart directory and run:
