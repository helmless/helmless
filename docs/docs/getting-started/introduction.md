# Introduction to Helmless

## What is Helmless?

Helmless is a workflow and collection of tools that lets you deploy serverless containers using Helm's familiar templating system - without the complexity of Kubernetes or Terraform. It's designed for teams who want:

- Simple container deployments using familiar Helm syntax
- Fast deployment cycles without infrastructure bottlenecks
- The flexibility to use different cloud providers
- A GitOps-friendly workflow

## How Does it Work?

At its core, Helmless:

1. Takes your container configuration as a Helm values file
2. Templates it into your cloud provider's native format
3. Deploys it using the provider's CLI

```yaml title="Your simple values.yaml"
name: my-service
image: us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello:latest
env:
  API_KEY: secret
```

## Core Concepts

### Values Files
Like Helm, Helmless uses `values.yaml` files to configure your deployments. These files define everything about your service:

```yaml
name: my-service
image: us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello:latest
env:
  API_KEY: secret
```

### Helmless Charts
Helmless charts template your values into cloud-provider specific formats. They handle:

- Resource configuration
- Environment variables
- Secrets and volumes mapping
- Scaling rules

### Deployment Actions
Helmless provides deployment tools that:

- Template your values
- Validate configurations
- Deploy to your cloud provider
