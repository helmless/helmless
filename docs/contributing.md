## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling

We use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage the tools and dependencies and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to check if everything is fine before committing.

To setup the development environment, install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) and the following plugins:

```sh
asdf plugin add python
asdf plugin add helm
asdf plugin add helm-docs
asdf plugin add pre-commit
```

Then install the tools and dependencies:

```sh
asdf install
```

After that install the pre-commit hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

## ü§ù Contributing to the Documentation

The documentation is built with [MkDocs for Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To run the documentation locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

For more information on how to contribute to the documentation, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/helmless/helmless/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file of the `helmless` repository. That is the place where the documentation is built and hosted.
