# Why Helmless?

Fast and easy deployments are critical for velocity. However, some organizations find Kubernetes too complex and Terraform too slow.

Helmless bridges this gap and provides fast and flexible deployments without requiring Kubernetes.

## üöÄ Faster Deployment Times

By switching to Helmless, you can reduce the time it takes to deploy your containers to Google Cloud Run from hours to minutes. Terraform is not built for fast iterations and continuous delivery. That however is exactly what you need for the deployment of your containers.

Helmless bypasses Terraform and directly integrates with your app repository. It uses Helm to render the Google Cloud Run manifest and then directly deploys it using the `gcloud` CLI.

## ‚≠ê Higher Deployment Frequency

Helmless allows you to deploy your containers to Google Cloud Run at any time, without waiting for the long approval and preview process of infrastructure changes done in Terraform. It can be directly integrated into your CI/CD pipeline and unlocks the full potential of continuous delivery.

## :material-kubernetes: Why not Kubernetes?

Wether you need Kubernetes or not is your decision to make. However, if you decided that for the current state of your organization or platform Kubernetes is not the right choice, Helmless will help you to bring a similar developer experience to Google Cloud Run. All without the overhead of Kubernetes or slowness of Terraform.

## :material-terraform: Why not Terraform?

Terraform is a great tool for managing infrastructure. However, it's not built for fast iterations and continuous delivery. That however is exactly what you need for the deployment of your containers.

Helmless bypasses Terraform and directly integrates with your app repository. It uses Helm to render the Google Cloud Run manifest and then directly deploys it using the `gcloud` CLI.

## :simple-helm: Why Helm?

Helm is a great tool for deploying applications to Kubernetes. However, it's not built for Google Cloud Run.

Helmless uses Helm to render the Google Cloud Run manifest and then directly deploys it using the `gcloud` CLI. This way you can still benefit from the developer experience of Helm, while not having to deal with the complexity of Kubernetes.
