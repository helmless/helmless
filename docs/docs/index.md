# Welcome to Helmless

Helmless is a workflow and collection of resources that allows you to deploy serverless containers to Google Cloud Run, and potentially other platforms (1), with Helm, bypassing the complexity of Kubernetes and Terraform.

1.   :material-information-slab-circle: See the [extending to other platforms](./architecture.md) page for more information.

It takes a container specification in the form of a Helm chart and a values file, and uses the templating feature of Helm to generate a Cloud Run manifest. This manifest is then deployed using the `gcloud` CLI.

Helmless gives you a powerful serverless deployment workflow that is very simple to use, yet flexible and extensible. It can be easily integrated into your existing CI/CD pipeline and is fully compatible with Helm charts and all tooling surrounding it.
